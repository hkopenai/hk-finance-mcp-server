# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on establishing the Memory Bank for the HK Finance MCP Server project. This involves creating and initializing the core documentation files to ensure project continuity and clarity of purpose, especially given the memory reset between sessions.

## Recent Changes
- **Memory Bank Setup**: Initiated the creation of the Memory Bank directory and core files, starting with 'projectbrief.md' and 'productContext.md'. These documents lay the foundation for project scope and purpose.
- **Project Structure Review**: Reviewed the existing project structure to understand the components of the HK Finance MCP Server, which includes tools for various financial data points specific to Hong Kong.

## Next Steps
- Complete the creation of remaining core Memory Bank files: 'systemPatterns.md', 'techContext.md', and 'progress.md'.
- Review and refine the content of all Memory Bank files to ensure they accurately reflect the project's current state and future direction.
- Begin exploring the codebase in detail to document system architecture, technical decisions, and design patterns in 'systemPatterns.md'.
- Identify and document the technologies and development setup in 'techContext.md' to provide a clear technical context for the project.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Documentation Priority**: Deciding to prioritize comprehensive documentation from the outset to mitigate the impact of memory resets. This ensures that all project knowledge is captured in the Memory Bank.
- **Scope Clarification**: Considering how to best align the Memory Bank content with the specific needs of the HK Finance MCP Server, focusing on financial data integration via MCP.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Hierarchical Documentation**: Following a hierarchical structure for Memory Bank files as outlined in 'build_memory_bank.md', ensuring that each file builds upon the previous one for a cohesive understanding.
- **Markdown Format**: Using Markdown for all documentation to maintain consistency and readability across the Memory Bank.
- **Focus on MCP Integration**: Emphasizing documentation of MCP-specific integration patterns to aid developers in using the financial tools provided by the server.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Initial Setup Importance**: Learned that setting up the Memory Bank early in the project lifecycle is critical for maintaining continuity, especially with memory resets. This setup acts as the sole reference point for project history and direction.
- **Project Specificity**: Gained insight into the unique focus of the HK Finance MCP Server on Hong Kong financial data, which requires tailored documentation to address specific user needs and data sources.
- **Documentation Workflow**: Understood the need for a systematic approach to updating Memory Bank files, particularly 'activeContext.md' and 'progress.md', to keep track of ongoing work and project evolution.

## Revision History
- **Initial Draft**: June 18, 2025 - Creation of the active context document to capture the current focus and next steps for the HK Finance MCP Server Memory Bank setup.
