# Progress Documentation for HK Finance MCP Server

## Project Status
- **Initial Setup**: Completed. Core Memory Bank files established for project continuity.
- **Codebase Exploration**: Completed. Reviewed project structure and key files for financial tools.
- **Integration Testing**: Completed. Modified test files to run integration tests with live data, executed successfully.
- **Unit Test Review**: Completed. Identified gaps in edge case coverage for all financial tools.
- **Unit Test Enhancement**: Completed. Added tests for edge cases such as invalid data, network failures, boundary conditions, and empty API responses for all tools.
- **Supplementary Documentation**: Completed. Created detailed documentation for complex features and integrations of all financial tools in the 'memory-bank' directory.
- **Pylance Type Error Fixes**: Completed. Addressed type errors in test files for invalid input scenarios across all financial tools (Business Registration, Coin Cart, Credit Card, HKMA Tender, Negative Equity Mortgage).
- **Test Failure Fix**: Completed. Fixed KeyError in 'fetch_neg_equity_data' function to handle empty or malformed JSON data for Negative Equity Mortgage tool.
- **Invalid JSON Test Failure Fix**: Completed. Updated 'fetch_neg_equity_data' to raise an exception for invalid JSON data, resolving the test failure in 'test_invalid_json_data'.

## What's Working
- All financial tools (Business Registration, Coin Cart, Credit Card, HKMA Tender, Negative Equity Mortgage) have robust unit and integration tests.
- Integration tests successfully fetch live data from IRD and HKMA APIs.
- Unit tests now cover a wide range of edge cases, improving tool reliability.
- Comprehensive documentation for each tool is available, covering purpose, features, integrations, usage, limitations, and future enhancements.
- Pylance type errors in test files for invalid input scenarios have been resolved, ensuring cleaner code and better maintainability.
- The 'fetch_neg_equity_data' function now handles empty or malformed JSON data gracefully and raises an exception for invalid JSON, resolving test failures.

## What's Left to Build
- No immediate tasks pending. Awaiting user input for additional features, refinements, or new documentation needs.
- Potential future enhancements for tools are documented in individual tool documentation files for caching, filtering, and analytics.

## Known Issues
- None at this time. All identified Pylance type errors and test failures related to JSON handling have been addressed.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initially focused on establishing Memory Bank for continuity across sessions.
- Progressed to testing phases, first ensuring integration tests work with live data, then enhancing unit tests for robustness.
- Addressed the need for detailed documentation to support complex features and API integrations, ensuring all tools are well-documented for future reference.
- Resolved Pylance type errors in test files to improve code quality, focusing on invalid input scenarios and JSON data handling.
- Fixed a test failure in the Negative Equity Mortgage tool by adding robust error handling for JSON data retrieval.
- Finally, updated error handling to raise an exception for invalid JSON data, ensuring test expectations are met.
