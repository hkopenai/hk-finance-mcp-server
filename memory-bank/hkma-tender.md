# HKMA Tender Data Tool Documentation

## Overview
The HKMA Tender Data Tool is a component of the HK Finance MCP Server designed to fetch and process data related to tender results from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). This tool provides critical information on financial instruments and tender outcomes, which are essential for financial analysis and investment decisions in Hong Kong.

## Purpose
This tool addresses the need for detailed and up-to-date information on HKMA tender activities. It enables users to:
- Retrieve data on tender results for various financial instruments.
- Filter data by specific parameters such as date ranges and instrument types.
- Analyze tender outcomes to understand market trends and liquidity conditions.

## Key Features
- **Data Retrieval**: Automatically fetches JSON data from the HKMA's open data portal.
- **Data Parsing**: Processes JSON data into a structured format for easy access and analysis.
- **Filtering**: Allows users to specify parameters like date ranges, pagesize, and specific tender types to narrow down the data returned.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust mechanisms to handle invalid data formats, network issues, and API downtimes.

## Integration Details
- **API Source**: The tool integrates with the HKMA Open Data API, specifically targeting the tender results endpoint (e.g., `https://api.hkma.gov.hk/public/market-data-and-statistics/daily-monetary-statistics/tender-results`).
- **Data Format**: The API returns data in JSON format, which includes fields such as tender date, instrument type, offered amount, and accepted amount.
- **Dependencies**: Utilizes Python's `json` module for parsing and `requests` library for HTTP requests to fetch data.

## Usage
To use this tool via the MCP Server, invoke the `get_hkma_tender_data` function with optional parameters for filtering data:
```json
{
  "start_date": "2023-01-01",
  "end_date": "2023-12-31",
  "pagesize": 100,
  "tender_type": "EFBN"
}
```
- If no parameters are provided, it defaults to fetching the most recent tender results.
- The response includes a JSON array of tender results within the specified criteria.

## Limitations
- **Data Availability**: Dependent on the HKMA's data update frequency and availability.
- **Rate Limits**: Subject to any rate limiting imposed by the HKMA API, though not explicitly documented.
- **Historical Data**: Limited to the range of data provided by the HKMA, which may not cover very old records.

## Error Handling and Edge Cases
- **Invalid JSON Data**: The tool checks for malformed JSON responses and raises an exception with a descriptive message.
- **Network Failures**: Implements error reporting for connection issues to ensure users are informed of data retrieval problems.
- **Boundary Conditions**: Handles edge cases for filter parameters, such as invalid dates, excessively large pagesize values, or unsupported tender types.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement caching to reduce load on the HKMA API for frequently requested data ranges.
- Add support for more detailed analytics on tender results, such as trend analysis or comparative statistics.
- Enhance error messages with more specific diagnostic information for troubleshooting.
