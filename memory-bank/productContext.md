# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The HK Finance MCP Server project exists to address the need for a specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides access to financial data and services specific to Hong Kong. It aims to bridge the gap between financial information systems and developers or users who require structured, reliable access to such data through MCP tools.

## Problems It Solves
- **Accessibility**: Financial data in Hong Kong is often fragmented across various sources, making it challenging for developers to integrate this information into their applications. This project centralizes access to key financial data points.
- **Standardization**: By adhering to the MCP framework, it ensures a standardized way of accessing financial tools and resources, reducing integration complexity.
- **Reliability**: Users need accurate and up-to-date financial information for decision-making. This server focuses on maintaining high data quality and reliability.
- **Extensibility**: Financial needs evolve over time, and this project provides a foundation that can be extended with additional tools and services as required.

## How It Should Work
- **Integration**: The server integrates seamlessly with the MCP ecosystem, allowing users to access financial tools via standardized MCP calls.
- **Data Delivery**: It fetches and processes financial data from relevant Hong Kong sources, delivering it in a structured format suitable for application use.
- **Toolset**: Offers a suite of tools covering various financial aspects such as business registration, credit card details, coin cart information, HKMA tenders, and negative resident mortgage data.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increasing data requests and tool additions without compromising performance.
- **Security**: Implements necessary safeguards to protect sensitive financial data during transmission and storage.

## User Experience Goals
- **Ease of Use**: Developers should find it straightforward to integrate with the server using MCP protocols, with clear documentation and intuitive tool interfaces.
- **Reliability**: Users should trust the data provided, experiencing minimal downtime and consistent accuracy in financial information.
- **Responsiveness**: The server should respond quickly to requests, ensuring that financial data is delivered in a timely manner for real-time applications.
- **Support**: Provide adequate support channels for users to report issues, request new features, or seek clarification on tool usage.
- **Feedback Loop**: Encourage user feedback to continuously improve the server's offerings and address any pain points in the user journey.
